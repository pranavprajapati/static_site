## Hello! I'm Pranav ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Data Scientist** based in New York City working at *[Verisk Analytics](https://www.maplecroft.com/).* My work mainly focuses on using **Natural Language Processing** to analyze key political, economic, social and environmental risks affecting global business and investors.

I enjoy breaking down complex problems using techniques of software engineering and data science. Iâ€™m interested in problems concerning machine learning and its practical applications, especially those that deal with its deployment, engineering, and use. 

 The goal of this site is to help solidify my knowledge of these topics and hopefully make them easy to learn for others. I will try to cover code and theory based tutorials , share my work experiences or a fun project I worked on. Feel free to look around!

A few interesting things about me. When not at work I enjoy playing cricket, travel, [cook](my_food_expertise) and explore new cuisines. I am an amateur DJ; I love mixing tracks and play for friends and family. Lastly, I love learning. Every day I push myself to learn something new, whether that be about machine learning, software engineering, or miscellaneous facts about the universe.
