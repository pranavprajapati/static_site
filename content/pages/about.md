Hello! I'm Pranav ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist 

A few interesting things about me. I love to read science fiction (my favorite is Frank Herbert's Dune). I am also an avid gamer. I love to play competitive strategy games and first-person shooters. Lastly, I love learning. Every day I push myself to learn something new, whether that be about machine learning, software engineering, or miscellaneous facts about the universe.

This means breaking down complex problems

This site is my attempt to give a bit back. I cover how-to guides, information arbitrages, and occasional opinions

I love learning about practical applications of data and techniques of software engineering and data analysis. The goal of this site is to help solidify my knowledge of these topics and hopefully make them easy to learn for others.

Iâ€™m currently the Machine Learning Lead at Monzo in London, where weâ€™re focusing on building machine learning systems that optimise the app and help the company scale.

My work has always focused on applications that use machine learning - this has taken me from recommender systems to urban computing and travel information systems, digital health monitoring, smartphone sensors, and banking. You can read more about my work and research in the Press & Speaking and Publications sections.

Here, youâ€™ll find some of my thoughts, works, and notes on software development, systems, machine learning, and research. I hope that youâ€™ll spend a nice time here, so go grab yourself a cup of coffee and feel free to look around!

Iâ€™m interested in problems concerning machine learning and its applications, especially those that deal with its deployment, engineering, and use. Furthermore, Iâ€™m also learning about distributed systems and infrastructure.
