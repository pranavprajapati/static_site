Hello! I'm Pranav ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist 

A few interesting things about me. I love to read science fiction (my favorite is Frank Herbert's Dune). I am also an avid gamer. I love to play competitive strategy games and first-person shooters. Lastly, I love learning. Every day I push myself to learn something new, whether that be about machine learning, software engineering, or miscellaneous facts about the universe.

This means breaking down complex problems

This site is my attempt to give a bit back. I cover how-to guides, information arbitrages, and occasional opinions
