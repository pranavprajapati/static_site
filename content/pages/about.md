Hello! I'm Pranav ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist 



A few interesting things about me. I love to read science fiction (my favorite is Frank Herbert's Dune). I am also an avid gamer. I love to play competitive strategy games and first-person shooters. Lastly, I love learning. Every day I push myself to learn something new, whether that be about machine learning, software engineering, or miscellaneous facts about the universe.

This site is my attempt to give a bit back. I cover how-to guides, information arbitrages, and occasional opinionsÂ².

Thanks for dropping by!
